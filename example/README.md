# Example PlayFab Project

This should serve as a reference for how to make use of the PlayFab SDK. Please
make an issue if you have any questions!

# Building

A prebuilt example is included in the repo (see `example/example.rbxl`).

To build the example project you'll either need Foreman installed, or Rojo and
Wally installed individually. Simply install packages with `wally install`, and
then build with `rojo build --output example.rbxl`. You need to be in the
`example` directory.
